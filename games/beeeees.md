BEEEEES! is a real-time hex and dice game.

Your dice are your beeeees! The frenzy flies as they buzz about pollenating colorful flowers and constructing hives, all for the glory of your Queen!

Compete and cooperate with your opponents in real time to claim the best resources in your bid to bee the best!
