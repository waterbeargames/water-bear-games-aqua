Cat Quest: Space Adventure is Water Bear Game's first game, created during <a href="https://startupweekend.org/" target="_blank">Startup Weekend</a>.

Once upon a time in the near-enough future, the Cats of the Earth began to develop special powers. This did not change their behavior much (they still mostly ignored us humans), but it was just plain creepy. In a show of fear and solidarity, we banished the Cats to all edges of the Solar System. Quite a sight all those one-way rockets to space…

Anyway, we shouldn’t have been so hasty. The Dogs eventually developed powers, and they weren’t so interested in being Man&rsquo;s best friend anymore&hellip;
