1. Roll the dice.
1. Get pretzels.
1. ????
1. PROFIT

A simple board game made just for <a href="http://pretzcon.com/" target="_blank">PretzCon</a> 2013 (and you!).

Water Bear Games wanted to contribute to our local Omaha board games convention PretzCon, and noticed that the organizers were selling custom dice with pretzels on the one pip side. We created this quick, free filler game to encourage people to purchase dice. This game was the primary reason that PretzCon sold out of their dice! So we feel pretty good about helping out our convention organizer friends.
