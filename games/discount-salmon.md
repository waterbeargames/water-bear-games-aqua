Players are fishmongers whose supply comes exclusively from the worldâ€™s most contaminated body of water: Lake Miasma. Every single thing that comes out of that cesspool has SOMETHING wrong with it. How do you make a profit out of this thing?

This is a trick taking game in which players simultaneously try to resolve fish quality issues and make it more difficult for other players to do the same by making bad fish even worse. The winning player is the one who has accumulated the most fish when all the fish cards have been resolved.
