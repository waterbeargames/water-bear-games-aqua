Kingmaker: The Reluctant Coronation is a turn-based card draft game, where your goal is to _not_ become king.

You don&ndash;t want to be king. When you&ndash;re the king, you have so many responsibilities, and your people hate you, and some people want to assassinate you, and it&ndash;s just not your thing. Your goal in Kingmaker is to make someone else the king, making them the loser, and making you&mdash;the Kingmaker (see what we did there?)&mdash;the winner!

As the representative of your kingdom, you bestow gifts upon the other representatives which will make them king if they end up with all five&mdash;the ring, the robe, the crown, the throne, and the sceptre. If you give them the _last_ item that makes them king, you win!

However, by giving other players these cards, you are also giving them powers. For example, the robe allows you to move a card to someone else, the crown allows you to name a card and anyone with that card in their hand is forced to play it on themselves, etc. You are also trying to give your opponents the five items all in the same color (all red, yellow, or blue cards) to make them king. Kingmaker is a careful strategy game of making someone else king by giving them the required cards, but balancing that goal with not giving your opponents too much power.
