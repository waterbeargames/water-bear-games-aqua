**We did not make Acquire**, but we love it so much that we remixed the cards.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquire" target="_blank">Acquire</a> is a game designed by Sid Sackson which was originally published in 1962. Players compete to accumulate the most money by investing in hotels which grow and acquire smaller hotels.

[Marcus had a custom high-quality version of Acquire created](/2016/05/so-we-have-a-custom-built-acquire-game-now/), and we liked the cards so much that we are providing them for print &amp; play. The simple but bold artwork is inspired by 1960s graphic design trends.

The print &amp; play contains the hotel share cards and reference charts. You'll need your own copy of Acquire with the board, tiles, and money to play the full game.
